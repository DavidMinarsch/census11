# MRP general notes:

## Mister P: What’s its secret sauce? (Gelman)

- the use of multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) to estimate state-level public opinion is increasing

- State predictor: Use a substantive group-level predictor for state. Using more than one is unlikely to be helpful, especially if noisily estimated.

- Interactions. Interactions between individual cell-level predictors are not necessary.

- Typologies. Adding additional individual types (by religious or income categories) does not improve performance on average in small samples.

- Other group-level predictors. Adding continuous predictors for demographic group-level variables (akin to the state level predictor recommended) does not improve performance on average.

He agrees with everything they write above. Good state-level predictors are crucial if you’re using getting Mister P to get estimates in all the states.

## Comparing Strategies for Estimating Constituency Opinion from National Survey Samples (Hanretty et al.)

multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) identifies four possible ways in which researchers can improve on the “direct” estimates generated by disaggregating a national survey and estimating area-specific opinion based solely on area-specific sub-samples:
- smoothing estimates toward the “global” sample mean (global smoothing);
- demographic individual-level predictors of opinion and post-stratifying estimates using information about the demographic make-up of each area (individual-level predictors and post-stratification (ILPP));
- area-level predictors of opinion;
- smoothing estimates “locally” based on geodata (local smoothing).

Main findings:
- By itself, global smoothing contributes little to the performance of constituency opinion estimates. In contrast, we find that both ILPP and local smoothing contribute non-trivially to the performance of constituency opinion estimates, even in the presence of all other MRP elements. However, substantially larger and more consistent gains in performance come from the use of an extensive set of constituency-level predictors.
